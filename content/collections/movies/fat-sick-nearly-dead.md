overview: "100 pounds overweight, loaded up on steroids and suffering from a debilitating autoimmune disease, Joe Cross is at the end of his rope and the end of his hope. In the mirror he saw a 310lb man whose gut was bigger than a beach ball and a path laid out before him that wouldn't end wellâ€” with one foot already in the grave, the other wasn't far behind. FAT, SICK &amp; NEARLY DEAD is an inspiring film that chronicles Joe's personal mission to regain his health."
