overview: "What happens when a screenwriter (Brooks) loses his edge, he turns to anyone he can for help... even if it's the mythical \"Zeus's Daughter\" (Stone). And he's willing to pay, albeit reluctantly, whatever price it takes to satisfy this goddess, especially when her advice gets him going again on a sure-fire script. However, this is not the limit of her help, she also gets the writer's wife (MacDowell) going on her own bakery enterprise, much to the chagrin of Brooks, who has already had to make many personal sacrifices for his own help."
