overview: "When an asteroid threatens to collide with Earth, NASA honcho Dan Truman determines the only way to stop it is to drill into its surface and detonate a nuclear bomb.

Among them is the cocksure A.J. who Harry thinks isn't good enough for his daughter, until the mission proves otherwise."
