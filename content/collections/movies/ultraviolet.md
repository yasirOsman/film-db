As they are set apart from "normal" and "healthy" humans, the world is pushed to the brink of worldwide civil war  aimed at the destruction of the "diseased" population. In the middle of this crossed-fire is - an infected woman - Ultraviolet, who finds herself protecting a nine-year-old boy who has been marked for death by the human government as he is believed to be a threat to humans.'
