overview: 'It is written among the limitless constellations of the celestial heavens, and  in the depths of the emerald seas, and upon every grain of sand in the vast  deserts, that the world which we see is an outward and visible dream, of an  inward and invisible reality ... Once upon a time there was a golden city. In  the center of the golden city, atop the tallest minaret, were three golden  balls. The ancients had prophesied that if the three golden balls were ever  taken away, harmony would yield to discord, and the city would fall to  destruction and death. But... the mystics had also foretold that the city might  be saved by the simplest soul with the smallest and simplest of things. In the  city there dwelt a lowly shoemaker, who was known as Tack the Cobbler. Also in  the city... existed a Thief, who shall be ... nameless.'
