overview: "Anton is a cheerful but exceedingly non-ambitious 17-year-old stoner who lives to stay buzzed, watch TV, and moon over Molly, the beautiful girl who lives next door. However, it turns out that the old clich√© about idle hands being the devil's playground has a kernel of truth after all."
