overview: 'When best buds Rick and Fred begin to show signs of restlessness at home, their wives take a bold approach to revitalize their marriages: they grant the guys a "hall pass", one week of freedom to do whatever they want. At first, it seems like a dream come true, but they quickly discover that their expectations of the single life - and themselves - are completely and hilariously out of sync with reality.'
